>Built for Universal Compatibility â€” X = Explore the Potential of Universal Devices

This repository hosts the XUSB website at https://xusb.net. The site presents our work across three focus areas:

## [1.Smart Storage](https://xusb.net/project-1/)
The flagship work is Logical Split Disk (LSDisk), a hardware-level approach to reclaiming control over storage devices and virtualizing a single medium into multiple isolated disks without host-side drivers.
